                    Alina is a passionate personal trainer and nutritionist based in central London. She started Solid Nutrition London to provide a training and education service for local residents, assisting in the development of their physical and spiritual wellbeing, as well as to provide them with personally branded nutritional supplement products. What stood out to me about Alina was her passion for her clients and her firm belief in human connection. Keeping this in mind I designed Solid Nutrition London’s website to be a reflection of Alina herself and upon visiting the website, prospective clients can experience the closest thing to having already met Alina.

            <div class="insight ">
                <h3>Insight</h3>
                <p>By conducting research, such as a Competitor Analysis, I was able to design a website that would highlight Solid Nutrition London as something much more than its competitors. One major finding was how impersonal other ‘personal’ trainers’ websites were.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="branding ">
                <h3>Personal Branding</h3>
                <p>Reflecting on results from the Competitive Analysis, part of my recommendation was for Alina to brand herself as the face of Solid Nutrition London. Due to her business having been built from the ground up on word of mouth and Alina’s reputation for a person-centered business, my aim was to leverage visual design and personal branding to continue as close a personal experience as can be experienced via the web.</p>

        <p>The final result was a responsive website split into three, easy to find sections, with Alina herself at the center of the design.</p>

                <h3>User Experience</h3>
                <p>Solid Nutrition London’s branding would not work without current &amp; future clients experiencing something more than an online store - therefore part of the visual design also included an emphasis on a trainee’s 3 stage workout journey.</p>
